1. Install Go. Directions here: [HERE](https://golang.org/doc/install)
2. Run `go get golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present`
4. Run `go install golang.org/x/tools/cmd/present`
5. Pull this repo if you have not already
6. Assuming you followed the instructions in step one and added `$GOPATH/bin` to your `$PATH` you should be able to run `present` from the location of this README.
7. Navigate to the location the command spits out (`http://127.0.0.1:3999` for me)
